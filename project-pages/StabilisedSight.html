          <div class="body-text">The system is required to stabilise itself when undergoing any changes in the pitch and the yaw planes. When the user inputs a turning rate for the device, the device must respond within a 100ms and start to move. A joystick is used to povide turning rate commands to the platform. When undergoing movement the device should have full 360° turning capabilities in the yaw axis. Finally thr device should output the video feed from the camera.  </div>
          <div class="body-text">The system uses a two control systems. A positional PID controller is used for the device to maintain aim when it is in a stabilising state. A speed PID controller is used when the user inputs a desired turning rate for the device to achieve. The platform switches between the two controllers. The stabilising controller is only on when the user provides no input. The platform transfer function was calculated and used to design a PID controller in MATLAB. The originally calculated values were used to further fine tune the response of the controller, compensating for variables that cannot easily be quantified, such as friction. Using the PID gain values from the rate controller as initial values the PID gains for the position controller was then also fine tuned for an suitable response. </div>
          <div class="body-text">360° of movement was achieved using a slip ring in the base of the platform, and making it the pivoting point of the platform. This resulted in the motor using a gear to rotate the platform around the pivot shaft. Finally due to this slipring implementation digital video could not be used. A block camera with analogue video output was used and the 2 wires for the signal and ground was passed through the slipring.</div>
